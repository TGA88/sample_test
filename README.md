# Nextjsapp-Boilerplate example

this template is inteded to use for creating new project that is included jest , react-testing-libary , redux-toolkit.
I have configured for jest and redux-toolkit. So you can start writting the test and to be able to use redux. 

## How to use

After clone the repo then run command below
```bash
npm install 
```

run this command when you want to dev
```bash
npm run dev
```

run this command when you want to test
```bash
npm run test-watch 
```

run this command when you want to build for release
```bash

```

### For Testing
you just only create test file with extionsion as .test.js or spec.js in the same place of your component or in folder \__test__ .
